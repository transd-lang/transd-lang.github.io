	<p>For programmers it is often best to take a look into practical examples of language's
	code to make a quick evaluation of the language. Here you will find two short Transd program
	examples with detailed comments about every line of code.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Top rank per group</h3>
	<p>This example is a solution of the 
	<a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Top_rank_per_group#Transd">"Top rank per group"</a> task
	on rosettacode.org. Given a bunch of tabular data about employees, their departments and
	salaries we must select several highest paid employees from each department and print their
	records. The data consists
	of list of rows, where each row has the following format:</p>
	<pre>Employee_name - Employee_ID - Salary - Department</pre>	
	<p>To solve this task we will use Transd's capabilities for processing structured data in a 
	database-like fashion: we will create a database-like structure out of this data, index it, 
	and	make a query to select the needed records.
	
	Below is the file content with the data and the code. The code lines are enumerated for 
	referencing purposes, and line numbers do not belong to the code.</p>

	<p>Detailed comments about each line.</p><br>
<pre>1. #lang transd</pre>
<p>A compiler directive ("shebang") indicating that this file contains Transd source code.
All Transd source files should have this as the first line.</p><br>
<pre>2. MainModule: {</pre>
<p>All code in Transd is grouped into <em>modules</em>. Each module should have its unique name.
"MainModule" is a standard name indicating that this module contains the <em>start function</em> (that is
the program's entry point like the 'main' function in C.)</p><br>
<pre>3. table : String(</pre>
<p>Variable declaration (and definition). The name 'table' in this module will be a reference
to a string containing the tabular data. Transd is strongly typed and all variables must be given
a type at the point of declaration. The variable's type should be declared either explicitly, 
as is the case here, or it can be assigned implicitly if it can be unambiguously deduced from
the right part of the assignment expression (as we will see later in this example). Assignment
expressions for module variables in Transd have the form of name/value pair with colon as the 
separator.</p><br>
<pre>4. N: 2,</pre>
<p>Another variable declaration. The task requires that the number of top-paid employees selected
for each department should be parameterized. We declare the parameter named "N" with the
value of 2. Here the variable's type <code>Int</code> is deduced automatically. In case we needed a number 
variable of a floating point type <code>Double</code>, we would declare it as <code>N: 2.0</code>. The comma at the
end of this line is the Transd's statement separator.</p><br>
<pre>5. _start: (λ (with base TSDBase()</pre>
<p>Here we meet with the most important part of Transd: function (or <code>lambda</code> as it is called in
Transd because it can represent several kinds of functions and function-like things). In fact, 
the whole solution of the task will be contained in the function that we begin to define on this 
line. The name "_start" is the standard Transd name for the entry point function, from which the
program's execution begins.<br> 
All function definitions (as well as function calls) are contained 
between two parentheses. No other separators (commas, etc.) inside definition. The function
definition should start with the keyword 'lambda' which can for brevity be substituted with the
greek letter 'λ' (unicode number: 955 (0x3BB)) as is done here. This keyword is an analog of 
'def', 'defun', 'function', etc. in other languages.<br>
A function definition in Transd consists of two parts: the parameter list (the <em>function's signature</em>) 
and the expression list (the <em>function's body</em>). The "_start" function doesn't have parameters 
(command line arguments, if any, are accessed in other way), so it's definition only consists of 
the expression list and this list has a single expression: declaration of a local variable 'base' 
along with its scope block. All our further computation will be taking place inside this block.<br> 
Transd is a block scoped language; blocks are created with the special 'with' function: it's 
parameter list is the place where local variables are declared, and its body is, basically, 
the block within which its local variables only exist and can be used for computations.<br>
The 'base' variable has <code>TSDBase</code> type which is a built-in database-like structure: TSD stands
for <em>Transd Structured Data</em>.</p><br>
<pre>6. (load-table base table)</pre>
<p>First, we populate our database with data by calling the 'load-table' method on our database 'base'.<br>
As was already mentioned, function definitions and function calls are enclosed in parentheses. 
Such parenthesized construction in Transd is called a <em>form</em>. The structure of the definition 
form was already described (three parts of the definition form are the keyword 'lambda', then 
parameters and body), the structure of the calling form is no less simple: the first word in the 
calling form is always the name of the called function. If the 
function that is being called is an object's method, as in this case, then the second expression in
the form should specify the object for which this method is called. All other expressions in the form are treated as parameters 
for the function being called. Here we pass as the parameter to the 'load-table' method the 
string with our employees data, which string already has the format that is understood by the method.
<br>The first line in the table contains the <em>field names</em> (that is the names of the columns) for out data. The subsequent
lines are treated as the individual <em>records</em> for the database. Each TSD database should have a 
<em>key field</em> (or combination of fields) which uniquely distinguishes each record, that is no two
records in the database can contain the same value for the key field. In our table such field
is "EmployeeID".<br>Using these basic format principles, any tabular data can be converted to 
a TSD database.</p><br>
<pre>7. (build-index base "Department")</pre>
<p>Another method call on our database. The task says that the data should be shown for
each department. So we need to build the <em>index</em> for the "Department" field. The structure of the
call form is already familiar: the method name first, then the object, and the parameter,
which in this case is the name of the field that must be indexed.</p><br>
<pre>8. (with rows (tsd-query base select ["Department"] distinct)</pre>
<p>Here is another novelty: we make an already familiar local variable (named 'rows') declaration 
with the 'with' function, but in this time we don't declare the variable's  type, but rather initialize it with
the whatever type the value returned by the 'tsd-query' function has, so the compiler will automatically assigns the
same type to the 'rows' variable as the return type of 'tsd-query' function.<br>
The 'rows' name means that the variable will reference the structure containing the result of a  
database query, which result is a vector (array) of the rows selected by the query.<br>
The 'tsd-query' function performs queries on a TSD database: it receives a set of criteria and returns the data from the 
database corresponding to those criteria. The syntax of TSD query is very much inspired with
the familiar SQL syntax, but it should be noted, that a TSD database is not a relational
database per se, but rather belongs to the class of "document-oriented databases", so the syntax 
resemblance is just formal.
of .<br>
The details of TSD query syntax can be found in documentation, and here it's enough to say that
this 'tsd-query' call will select in 'base' all the distinct values of the "Department" field. In this
particular case the query will return a vector with the following array of data (sorting is unimportant):<br>
["D101"]<br>
["D050"]<br>
["D202"]<br>
["D190"]<br>
</p><br>
<pre>9. (for row in rows do</pre>
<p>This line introduces one of the Transd's <em>control flow statements</em>: the 'for' iterating 
statement. Here we declare a 'row' variable with the type that of the individual elements
of 'rows' vector. This type - namely <code>String</code> - will be deduced automatically by the compiler
during the compilation stage, and if there further in the code should be a try to use the
'row' not as a <code>String</code>, the error will be reported at the compiling stage rather than at
run-time (Transd is strongly typed).<br>
The 'for' construction behaves similarly to that in other languages: the 'rows' vector is
traversed from the first element to the end with executing the form's body for each
element; the 'row' variable receives on each iteration the value of the current element;
the 'do' marker signifies the beginning of the form's body that should be executed for each 
element.<br> 
The meaning of this line is that we iterate over each distinct department name, and do 
something using it in the form's body.</p><br>
<pre>10. (with recs (tsd-query base select all </pre>
<p>Here we do the second database query, whose result will be assigned to the 'recs' variable.
This query call is more elaborated than the previous and spans three lines of code. The beginning 
part of the query on this line says that we are interested in all fields of the selected
records (in the previous query we selected only one 'Department' field). </p><br>
<pre>11. where (lambda Department String() (eq Department (get row 0))) </pre>
<p>Here the clause of the query named 'where' specifies the selection criterion. During
query every database record will be tested for satisfying this criterion. Selection criteria
in Transd are defined in the form of <em>predicate functions</em> (a predicate function is simply a
function that receives a parameter, does something, and returns 'true' or 'false' depending on
this particular parameter). The predicates for queries are defined using the same lambda
definition syntax which is used for other functions in the language (module functions, 
class methods, etc.). The predicate function in this case will receive the 'Department' field 
of the currently tested record, and will compare it with the department name that is 
currently being iterated (the 'row' variable on the 9-th line), if it matches, then the
record will be added to the results.<br>
The form <code>(get row 0)</code> is a little tricky. The matter is that, as we remember, the rows in
the query result are themselves vectors, and consequently the 'row' object is a vector.
So for accessing a particular field in it we call the vector's method 'get'. Since the rows
in the first query contain only one field ("Department"), we obtain with the 'get' method
the value of the first element in the vector (which has the index 0).</p><br>
<pre>12. sortby "Salary" desc limit N)</pre>
<p>The last clause of the query, specifying, if needed, additional actions on the query result.
As we need to select the top-paid employees, we sort the result by the "Salary" field in 
descending order (the highest salaries at the top), and in the end we apply our "N" parameter
for leaving in the result only N highest-paid employees for the department.</p><br>
<pre>13. (for rec in recs do </pre>
<p>Here we do the final iteration through the results of the last query, which will contain 
N employees with highest salaries. In the current case (with N=2) the 'recs' variable will
contain two employee records for the currently iterated department. As the 'for' construct 
on the 9-th line iterates through all departments, all the needed "N times number_of_departments" 
records will be printed.</p><br>
<pre>14. (textout rec "\n"))</pre>
<p>
The 'textout' function prints text to the screen or to other streams. Here it prints out two 
things: the vector containing an employee record and then ends the screen line with the 
newline symbol. <br>'textout' represents another kind of functions in Transd to the addition to 
already considered module functions ("_start") and object methods ("get"): 'textout' is a 
<em>built-in function</em>, although the syntax of working with all kinds of functions is unified and 
virtually doesn't differ. <br>Also, this line illustrates that parameters in Transd are passed 
to functions with whitespace as the delimeter, which arguably makes the syntax more readable.</p>
<p>The final result of this program printed on the screen is as follows:</p>
