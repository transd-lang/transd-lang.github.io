In 2018 Albert Berger was doing a research in computer graphics on the emergence of complex 
visual phenomena in the form of regular intricate patterns out of quite simple principles 
(known as <a href="img/moire.jpg">Moire effect</a>). The images were generated with a C++ 
program, in which a parameterized generating algorithm was hardcoded. The program was provided 
with a set of parameters from a <a href = "conffile.txt">configuration file</a>. For changing the base shading formula of the 
generating algorithm the program recompilation was needed.
</p><p>
Then the idea came to provide the shading formula in the configuration file as well in order to 
avoid frequent recompilations. The question was: how to do this? Using common extension 
languages (Python, Lua, Guile...) was not an option because of performance: the shading formula 
is called for each pixel in the image (1920x1200 image contains 2.3 million of pixels), and apart 
from individual images animations with hundreds of frames were also generated.
</p><p>
LuaJIT, deservedly renowned for its good performance within one API call, has, however,
rather heavy pre-call and post-call boilerplate code, so that in a scenario when a short function 
with several parameters, written on Lua, is called many times from the host program (e.g. a pixel 
shading function for generating images) the performance will drop.
</p><p>
Another, more promising, way was to use some existing library for dynamic compilation. But, on 
the one hand, the code that was originally needed to be compiled was rather simple (just basic 
math expressions), and, on the other hand, any JIT library requires some not insignificant work 
for the adaptation for particular needs, and also the library itself is a rather weighty 
third-party dependency.
</p><p>
So the way had been chosen to create a “home-made” language-like mini-framework that only handled 
(read and executed) the math expressions consisting of basic math operations (four arithmetic 
operations, power, root, etc.), and had the ability to work with variables (rather than just with 
numeric literals). This framework was ready at the end of 2018, and records with formulas in 
config files looked like this:
</p><p>
<font face="monospace">comp_x1: “(/ (+ (* b -1) (sqrt (- (pow b 2) (* (* 4 a) c )))) (* a 2))”</font>
</p><p>
What has influenced the choice of the syntax for the language? First, the syntax should fit into 
the existing format of config files (name/value pairs, divided by comma, and grouped in blocks, 
enclosed in curly braces) for lessening the amount of work for writing the parser. And, second, 
out of the same considerations the LISP-like style for expressions had been chosen: because it's 
easier to handle without additional parsing libraries.
</p><p>
That framework had been built in such a short time and worked so smoothly that at the time it 
was believed that with not so big efforts the framework could be promoted into a prototype of a 
real programming language, which can be built-in into any program (that needs to be easily 
extensible and configurable) and doesn't require any dependencies.
</p><p>
The work on the new language has started (in December, 2018) with the implementation of the 
classes, and the complexity that this feature has required to deal with was much greater than 
was anticipated. (The problem was that run-time speed was the main consideration in the case of 
classes just as most other features of the language: the feature either can be made to run 
sufficiently fast, or it is not implemented.)
</p><p>
The long story short, the first time the classes subsystem was in the working state was in 
March, 2020. After that in a rapid succession other features were implemented: loops, condition 
statements, first container (vector), scoping blocks, import and permissions subsystems, etc.
