<h3 id="about-transd">About Transd</h3>

<h4 id="what-is-transd">What is Transd?</h4>

<p>Transd is a programming language implemented with the meta-compilation technology which allows the programs written on Transd to run faster than on other non-compiled languages and in the same time not to employ the real compilation to machine code.</p>

<h4 id="what-was-the-motivation-for-its-creation">What was the motivation for its creation?</h4>

<p>We needed an extension language which was 1.fast; 2.compactly implemented; 3.not compiled.</p>

<h4 id="how-fast-is-transd">How fast is Transd?</h4>

<p>Depending on the computational patterns of the code, the programs written on it run on the average from 50% to 80% of native speed.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-costs-of-this-efficiency">What are the costs of this efficiency?</h4>

<p>Increased usage of memory. Transd programs need considerably more memory for running than their native analogs.</p>

<h4 id="how-compact-is-transd">How compact is Transd?</h4>

<p>Currently it can be added as a library to a C++ program in the form of two files: "transd.hpp" and "transd.cpp". At the time of this writing (May, 2021) these two files have in sum about 12 000 lines of code. It is a design goal that this number remained well under 30 000.</p>

<h4 id="is-it-ready-for-using">Is it ready for using?</h4>

<p>Not for production. Presently (May, 2021), it's in alpha stage and being readied for the beta version. Early adopters are welcome to try it.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-the-transds-license">What is the Transd's license?</h4>

<p>Its source code C++ library (files 'transd.hpp' and 'transd.cpp') can be used freely for any purposes with the sole condition that the source code remain unchanged. On the early stage of language usage we want to prevent the proliferation of incompatible dialects of Transd.</p>

<h3 id="about-author">About author</h3>

<p>Transd language and its meta-compiler (Tourbillon) were created by Albert Berger (Saint-Petersburg, Russia) in 2020, after his idea that computation can be efficiently implemented with a finite-automata network has been successfully tested Ä­n the end of 2018.</p>
