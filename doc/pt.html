<li>2. Overview of Transd</li>
</ul>

<p>Comprehensive documentation for Transd is currently work in progress. Here is a preliminary
glance on general concepts and approaches of programming with Transd.</p>
<p>The main novelty of Transd is that it does not classify either as a compiled or as an 
interpreted language. This novelty is a consequence from the main motivation for creation
of Transd: there was a need in a language for extending and configuring programs, and 
this language had to be:</p>
<ul style="padding: 10px 0px 15px 52px; margin-top: -20px">
<li>faster (though, possibly, somewhat simpler) than existing interpreted 
solutions (including those which are "compiled" into byte code); </li>
<li>free from all the dependencies and complications of shipping an extensible program with 
a compiler and doing just-in-time compilation;</li>
</ul>
<p>
To put it simply, we wanted a language which takes best from two worlds: the speed of
compiled languages and the simplicity and portability of interpreted ones. 
</p>
<h2>Quick Start</h2>
<p>Transd as an embeddable language has two aspects in its usage and, accordingly, two interfaces: 
the external syntax (that is properly the language itself) and the internal API through which 
the host program uses Transd.</p>  
 
<h2>Overview of Transd</h2>
<p>Transd is a strongly typed statically scoped language. It facilitates best the procedural and
functional styles of programming, and also offers limited options in the OOP paradigm (currently, 
it has classes, but does not support inheritance).</p>
