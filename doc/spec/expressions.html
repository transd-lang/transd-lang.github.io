Expression is a piece of code which can be evaluated and whose data value can be obtained. Technically, in Transd every <em>form</em> (code enclosed within a pair of parentheses) is an expression, although many forms act as statements and return Null.<br /><br />Expressions comprise the lower, definitive part of Transd syntax, whereas the upper, declarative, part consists of statements. In particular, Transd for class methods definitions employs the fully parenthesized prefix notation, which can be best characterized by the following Wikipedia quote about the Functional Programming: “<em>...in which function definitions are trees of expressions that each return a value, rather than a sequence of imperative statements</em>”.<br /><br />Expressions in Transd are built out of basic units - <em>forms</em>. A form is an elementary expression enclosed by a pair of parentheses. A form cannot contain inside it other parentheses except when they enclose other form. That is any subexpression within a form must also be a legal form.<br /><br />Forms may represent any kind of expression usual in programming: elementary arithmetical operation, a function call, a procedure call, etc.<br /><br />Form&#39;s subexpressions are called constituents. A constituent can be a name (of a variable, a function, etc.), another parenthesized form, a number, a string literal, or a type expression.<br /><br />Forms have a regular structure. The first constituent of the form (called prefix) denotes the action that expression is supposed to perform. This may be an arithmetical operator such ‘+’, ‘-’, etc., comparison operator such as &#39;==&#39;, ‘&gt;’, etc., (or their verbal equivalents: ‘sum’, ‘dif’, ‘eq’, ‘greater’, etc.), or a function or procedure call. Subsequent constituents are operands or arguments which are passed to the expression&#39;s operation or function.<br /><br />Constituents are separated by a white space character: &lt;Space&gt;, ‘\t’ or ‘\n’.<br /><br />Examples of expressions:<br /><br /><div class="codebox"><div class="codebox">(<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">+&nbsp;</span>1&nbsp;1)<br />(<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">==&nbsp;</span>(<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">+&nbsp;</span>3&nbsp;5)&nbsp;(*&nbsp;2&nbsp;4))<br />(<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">computeDistance&nbsp;</span>Point(2&nbsp;3)&nbsp;Point(4&nbsp;5))<br />(<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">textout&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#3ad900;font-weight:400">&quot;five&nbsp;plus&nbsp;three&nbsp;equals&quot;</span>&nbsp;(<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">+&nbsp;</span>5&nbsp;3))<br />(<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">sqrt&nbsp;</span>(<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">+&nbsp;</span>(<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">pow&nbsp;</span>(<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">-&nbsp;</span>x1&nbsp;x2)&nbsp;2&nbsp;)&nbsp;(<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">pow&nbsp;</span>(<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">-&nbsp;</span>y1&nbsp;y2)&nbsp;2&nbsp;)&nbsp;)</div></div><br /><br /></div></body></html>
