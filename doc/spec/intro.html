It has strong support of the OO paradigm and some elements of functional programing style.<br /><br />Transd doesn&#39;t belong to the traditional compiled-interpreted scale, and can be classified as a “constructed” or “virtually compiled” language. It doesn&#39;t use an interpreter or virtual machine, what allows it to execute with almost native performance, and in the same time it doesn&#39;t use the compilation to machine code at run-time, which makes it a safer alternative to dynamically compiled languages.<br /><br />A Transd program can run as a stand-alone application (started via virtual compiler) or can play role of a library whose functions are called from a host program (usually written in C++).</div></body></html>
