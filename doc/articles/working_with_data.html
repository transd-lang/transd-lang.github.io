<h2 style="margin-top: 55px;color: #777">Using Transd for Working with Data</h2>
<hr width="100%" style="margin:0 0 35px 0;">
<p>The data related functionality in Transd subdivides into two areas: 
<ol style="margin: -5px 0 15px 25px;line-height: 2em">
<li>Data processing</li>
<li>Data importing</li>
</ol>
<p>
<i>Data processing</i> means the tasks where Transd is used as a tool for
querying and modifying an external dataset. 
</p>
<p><i>Data importing</i> means the cases where data is imported into
a Transd program and becomes an active part of the program.</p>

<p>This page after a short introduction describes three practical examples of using Transd for 
working with data: two examples for data processing and one for data importing.</p>

<h3>Data processing</h3>
<p>Transd can be used for working with various types of datasets. These types can be
classified into three categories: </p> 
<ol style="margin: -5px 0 5px 25px;line-height: 2em">
<li>Tables</li>
<li>Collections of records</li>
<li>Loosely organized data aggregates</li>
</ol>
<h4>Tables</h4>
<p>Tables is the most structured dataset type. All values in table datasets are logically
grouped into rows and columns. Transd defines the <code>Table</code> type, which
represents the table data structure. Rows in a <code>Table</code> object can have differently
typed fields. Fields of different records are combined into named columns. Each column can contain
values of one of the following types: 
<code>String</code>, <code>Int</code>, <code>Double</code>, <code>DateTime</code>.</p> 
<p>Transd can read and load table datasets stored in one of the several variations of
CSV format. Other formats, with some conversions, can be used too.
</p>

<h4>Collections of records</h4>
<p>A record is a structured description of some object. A record, can have differently
typed named fields, describing individual properies of the object. A collection of records is 
represented in Transd by the <code>TSDBase</code> data type. The difference of the 
<code>TSDBase</code> class from <code>Table</code> class is that records in a <code>TSDBase</code>
object, unlike rows in a table, can have different sets of fields.</p>
<p>A dataset with a collection of records can be stored as a set of TSD objects, that is
chunks of data in TSD format (TSD is short for "Transd Structured Data"). TSD format resembles
JSON with some additions, such as distinguishing between floating and integer numbers,
including arrays as object members, etc. (The source code of any Transd program is precisely
a collection of records, with program modules being records in TSD format.) </p>

<h4>Data aggregates</h4>
<p>A data aggregate is an assembly of loosely structured data, whose individual data chunks
(entries) have some classifiers, headers or tags (meta data), allowing to group these chunks
or connect them with each other into a hierarchical structure.</p>
<p>If the meta data in individual entries allows to connect them into a single logical
structure, then big collections of seemingly assorted data entries can organized into a TSDBase 
database and queried in a regular way.</p>
<p>This way of handling data is suited for working with knowledge databases, personal
notes, assorted ideas, etc.</p>

<h4>TSD Query Language</h4>
<p>
The central part of data processing in Transd is TSD query language - <b>TQL</b> (pronounced
'tee-quel'). All data processing tasks can be grouped into three main types:
</p>
<ol style="margin: -5px 0 15px 25px;line-height: 2em">
<li>Selecting data</li>
<li>Modifying data</li>
<li>Doing calculations on data</li>
</ol>
<p>TQL defines for these types of tasks three types of queries:</p>

<ol style="margin: -5px 0 15px 25px;line-height: 2em">
<li>SELECT</li>
<li>UPDATE</li>
<li>REDUCE</li>
</ol>

<p>TQL queries are performed uniformly on any kind of supported data structure. That is, a table,
a TSD database, or even a vector of values, can be queried using the same syntax of queries.</p>

<p>Example of a TQL 'select' query:</p>

<pre><code>
(tql table1 
    select: ["Book_title", "Price"]
    as: [[String(), Double()]]
    where: "Price < 50"
    satisfying: (lambda Author String() (match Author ".*Lovecraft.*"))
    sortby: "Price" :ascending
    limit: 5 
)
</code></pre>

<h3>Data importing</h3>
<p>Data importing means here converting external data into program objects. Data importing is
a powerful mechanism making it possible to outsource data related functionality from the program
to external means, and, using some universal data exchange format, to transfer and incorporate 
data objects, defined externally, directly into the program state at runtime.</p>

<p>Data importing can help both to reduce considerably the program size, as well as to use
for handling data specialized tools most appropriate for the task.</p>

<p>In Transd data importing is implemented on the basis of TSD data format, which is supported
at deep levels of the language.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<h4>Data processing</h4>

<p><b>Tables</b><br>
A basic example of using Transd for working with tables can be found <a href="https://transd.org/perftest.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>Assorted data aggregation</b><br>
An example program <a href="https://github.com/al-berger/knorg">"Knorg" (Knowledge Organizer)</a> works with loosely organized data.</p>

<h4>Data importing</h4>
<p>An example program <a href="../../afc/AFC_review.html">"AFC" (Audio Flow Combiner)</a> uses data importing for factoring out the
data handling code from the program.</p>
